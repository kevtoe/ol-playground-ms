# Layer Management System

## 🎨 Overview
This OpenLayers application now includes a comprehensive layer management system similar to Photoshop layers, allowing you to organize, control, and manipulate map features as individual layers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Accessing the Layer Panel
- Click the **Layers icon** (📋) in the top-left toolbar to open/close the layer panel
- The panel appears on the left side and can be toggled on/off

### Creating Layers
- Use any drawing tool (Line, Polygon, Circle, Rectangle, Bezier) to create features
- Each feature automatically becomes a layer in the panel
- Layers are named automatically based on their type (e.g., "Line 1", "Polygon 2")

## 🎯 Layer Management Features

### Basic Operations
- **👁️ Show/Hide**: Click the eye icon to toggle layer visibility
- **✏️ Rename**: Double-click layer name to edit it inline
- **🗑️ Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a layer
- **🔒 Lock**: Click the lock icon to prevent editing (UI ready)

### Selection
- **Click**: Select a single layer (highlights on map)
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Click**: Multi-select layers
- **Shift+Click**: Extend selection
- Selecting layers in the panel also selects them on the map

### Drag & Drop Reordering
- **Drag layers** up/down to change drawing order
- Visual feedback shows where the layer will be placed
- Higher layers draw on top of lower layers

## 📁 Group Management

### Creating Groups
- Click the **folder+ icon** in the panel header
- Groups help organize related layers

### Group Operations
- **Expand/Collapse**: Click the arrow next to group name
- **Group Visibility**: Hide/show all layers in a group at once
- **Rename Groups**: Double-click group name to edit
- **Delete Groups**: Click trash icon (layers remain, just ungrouped)

### Moving Layers to Groups
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag a layer onto a group to add it
- **Drop Zones**: Visual indicators show valid drop locations
- Layers can be moved between groups freely

## 🔍 Panel Features

### Search & Filter
- Use the search box to find layers by name
- Great for large projects with many layers

### Panel Controls
- **🔼🔽 Collapse All**: Expand/collapse all groups at once
- **📁+ Create Group**: Add a new layer group
- **⚙️ Settings**: Additional layer management options

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Layer Types & Icons
- **Line** (—): Straight lines and paths
- **Polygon** (⬜): Closed shapes and areas  
- **Circle** (⭕): Perfect circles
- **Bezier** (~): Smooth curved lines

### Group Selection
- Select entire groups to move all layers together
- Group visibility affects all child layers
- Nested organization for complex projects

### Bidirectional Sync
- Selecting layers in panel selects features on map
- Selecting features on map highlights layers in panel
- Always stay in sync between panel and canvas

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

### Integration
- Fully compatible with existing drawing tools
- Works with all import/export functionality
- Maintains existing styling and preset systems

### Performance
- Hidden layers don't render (better performance)
- Efficient drag & drop with visual feedback
- Optimized for large numbers of layers

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Organization**: Create groups before adding many layers
2. **Naming**: Rename layers immediately for better organization
3. **Visibility**: Hide layers you're not working on to focus
4. **Selection**: Use Ctrl/Cmd+click for multi-layer operations
5. **Reordering**: Drag layers to control drawing order

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure all drawing tools are working normally first
2. Try refreshing the page if layer sync seems off
3. Check browser console for any error messages
